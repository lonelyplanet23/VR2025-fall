# Copilot Instructions for Homework1

## Project Overview
This project is part of the "Real-Time 3D Graphics Fundamentals" course and focuses on implementing rasterization techniques. Rasterization is the process of converting vertex data into fragments, which correspond to pixels in the frame buffer. The project is built using OpenGL and includes tasks such as implementing the Bresenham line algorithm and rasterizing ellipses.

### Key Components
- **`src/`**: Contains the main source code for the project.
  - `main.cpp`: Entry point of the application.
  - `rasterization.cpp` and `rasterization.h`: Core files for rasterization functions. You need to implement `draw_line_bresenham` and `draw_ellipse` here.
  - `shader.cpp` and `shader.h`: Custom shader class for handling vertex and fragment shaders.
  - `utils.cpp` and `utils.h`: Utility classes, including `Vector2f` (2D float vector) and `Pixel` (representing screen pixels).
  - `shaders/`: Contains vertex and fragment shader files.
- **`deps/`**: Third-party dependencies, including GLFW, GLAD, and ImGui. Do not modify these files.
- **`build/`**: Contains build artifacts and configuration files generated by CMake.

## Developer Workflows
### Building the Project
1. Ensure you have CMake installed.
2. Run the `cmake` task in VS Code to configure the project:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```
3. Build the project using the `CMake: 生成` task or the `make` command.

### Running the Application
- The compiled executable `rasterization.exe` is located in the `build/Debug/` directory. Run it to test your implementation.

### Debugging
- Use the `cppdbg: rasterization.exe` debug configuration in VS Code to debug the application.

## Coding Conventions
- Follow the structure and style of the existing `draw_line_dda` function in `rasterization.cpp` as a reference for implementing `draw_line_bresenham` and `draw_ellipse`.
- Use the utility classes (`Vector2f`, `Pixel`) from `utils.h` to simplify vector and pixel operations.

## Notes for AI Agents
- Focus on `src/rasterization.cpp` for the main implementation tasks.
- Avoid modifying files in the `deps/` directory.
- Ensure compatibility with the existing build system and dependencies.
- When in doubt, refer to the `README.md` file for additional context and requirements.
